## Abstract

Proteins play crucial roles in various biological processes, primarily through interactions with other molecules, such as other proteins. These interactions are essential for cellular pathways and the maintenance of life. Predicting protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is challenging but vital for understanding cellular functions and disease mechanisms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes BioPrediction-PPI, an end-to-end framework for PPI prediction, with the aim of simplifying the process through the automation of a complete machine learning (ML) pipeline, eliminating the need for manual intervention.
BioPrediction-PPI automates the entire ML process, from feature extraction to interpretability, ensuring a user-friendly and accessible experience for researchers without specialized expertise. A review of related works demonstrates that BioPrediction-PPI is one of the few state-of-the-art end-to-end models, being the only one that does not rely on deep learning. It stands out for its ability to provide interpretability graphs, allowing the creation of minimally auditable models, and for having been extensively validated with the largest number of tools and datasets during its evaluation.
The performance of BioPrediction-PPI was assessed through comparative experiments with other tools mentioned in the literature, using various datasets. In five distinct experiments, our framework was compared with more than 31 tools developed by experts, covering over 15 datasets. These experiments included benchmarks such as the yeast and \textit{H. pylori} datasets, which have been exhaustively tested by numerous tools, as well as experiments involving human protein interactions and human-viral protein interactions, highlighting its importance in the study and development of therapies. The framework’s ability to handle cross-species cases, where it was trained on interactions and proteins from one species and tested on others, was also investigated. Finally, we explored the applications of the performance and interpretability graphs generated by BioPrediction-PPI, demonstrating their usefulness for model evaluation and experimental planning.
In summary, BioPrediction-PPI proved to be competitive with almost all evaluated models in at least one dataset, even without the use of deep learning. With the additional advantage of being a white-box model with auxiliary graphs and having undergone extensive validation, BioPrediction-PPI stands out as a promising tool for democratizing AI model development, benefiting biologists and non-experts in machine learning. This advancement can significantly accelerate research and development in biology and related fields.

* To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to propose a white-box automated pipeline for feature engineering and model training to classify interactions between biological sequences, competitive with models developed by experts.
  
* The pipeline was mainly tested on datasets regarding Protein-Protein Interactions.

* BioPrediction-RPI does not require specialist human assistance.

* BioPrediction-RPI can accelerate new studies, democratizing the use of ML techniques by non-experts in ML.

# COLAB


## Installing dependencies and package

#### Via miniconda (Terminal)

Installing BioPrediction using Miniconda to manage its dependencies, e.g.:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/0nurB/BioPredictionPPI.git BioPredictionPPI

$ cd BioPredictionPPI

$ git submodule init

$ git submodule update
```

**1 - Install Miniconda:** 

```sh

See documentation: https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

$ wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

$ chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

$ ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

$ export PATH=~/miniconda3/bin:$PATH

```

**2 - Create environment:**

```sh

conda create --name bioprediction-ppi python=3.11.5

```

**3 - Activate environment:**

```sh

conda activate bioprediction

```

**4 - Install packages:**

```sh

pip install -r requeriments.txt

```
## How to use

Execute the BioPrediction pipeline with the following command:

```sh
...
To run the code (Example): $ python BioPrediction.py -h

where:

    -input_interactions_train: CSV format file with the interaction table (firts and second columns the proteins name and third the label with 1 for interaction and 0 for non interaction), e.g., all-data/data_human_virus/Sars/interaction.csv
    -input_interactions_candidates: CSV format file with the interaction candidates to the prediction (also three columns, but the third put 2 for unlabeled candidates), e.g., all-data/data_human_virus/Sars/interaction.csv
    -sequences_dictionary: fasta format file with all the sequences, e.g., all-data/data_human_virus/Sars/dictionary.fasta

    Those dictionaries must contain all sequences in train, test, and candidates.

    -topology_features: uses topology features to characterization of the sequences, e.g., yes or no, default=yes)
    -output: output path, e.g., sars_experiment

    Use a string formant to execute BioPrediction, like this complete exemple:
    !python BioPrediction.py -input_interactions_train all-data/data_human_virus/Sars/interaction.csv -sequences_dictionary all-data/data_human_virus/Sars/dictionary.fasta -output sars_test -input_interactions_candidates all-data/data_human_virus/Sars/interaction.csv

```
